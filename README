The microSD BoosterPack allows you to add mass storage to your Launchpad design for data logging and program storage.  The design uses the Launchpad's SPI interface to communicate with the microSD card. Jumper blocks are provided to set which GPIOs are used for the microSD card's chip select and card detect signals. The board is equipped with stackable connectors, which means it can be used with other BoosterPacks. The Micro SD BoosterPack is compatible with the MSP430 LaunchPad, Tiva C LaunchPad (previously Stellaris). This board is designed by Sakoman Inc.
